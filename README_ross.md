# Ross 
# This version of recurring select includes a termination option to end the series after a number of occurrences or date
# I forked from https://github.com/Skookum/recurring_select
# To my own repo at: https://github.com/rossinkiwi/recurring_select/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/recurring_select_dialog.js.coffee.erb
# I then further modified the gem so that the "never" ends option is not available (the series cant be infinite)
# Those edits are in the file app/assets/javascripts/recurring_select_dialog.js.coffee.erb
